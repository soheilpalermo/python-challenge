Python Challenge - PyBank & PyPoll

Welcome to my Python Challenge repository, where I tackle two real-world problems using Python: PyBank and PyPoll. 
These projects are part of my efforts to apply my Python skills in a practical setting.

Repository Structure
This repository contains two main directories:

- PyBank: Analyses financial records
- PyPoll: Modernises vote-counting processes
- 
Each directory contains:

- main.py - The main Python script to run for each analysis.
- Resources/ - Contains the CSV files used for the analysis.
- analysis/ - Contains the output files from each script, including the results of the data analysis.

- PyBank
In the PyBank challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. This script calculates total months, total net amount of "Profit/Losses", monthly changes in "Profit/Losses", and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the period.

- PyPoll
The PyPoll challenge focuses on a script that helps a small, rural U.S. town modernize its vote-counting process. This script analyzes election data, calculating total number of votes, vote percentages, and vote counts for each candidate, and determines the election winner based on popular vote.

- Data Sources
The data files used in these projects are located in the Resources folder within each challenge's directory.

- Results
Results of the analyses are written to text files within the analysis folder of each respective directory.
