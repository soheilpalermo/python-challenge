Python Challenge - PyBank & PyPoll

Welcome to my Python Challenge repository, where I tackle two real-world problems using Python: PyBank and PyPoll. These projects are part of my efforts to apply my Python skills in a practical setting.

Repository Structure
This repository contains two main directories:

- PyBank: Analyzes financial records
- PyPoll: Modernizes vote-counting processes
Each directory contains:

- main.py - The main Python script to run for each analysis.
- Resources/ - Contains the CSV files used for the analysis.
- analysis/ - Contains the output files from each script, including the results of the data analysis.

- PyBank
In the PyBank challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. This script calculates total months, total net amount of "Profit/Losses", monthly changes in "Profit/Losses", and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the period.

- PyPoll
The PyPoll challenge focuses on a script that helps a small, rural U.S. town modernize its vote-counting process. This script analyzes election data, calculating total number of votes, vote percentages, and vote counts for each candidate, and determines the election winner based on popular vote.

Data Sources
The data files used in these projects are located in the Resources folder within each challenge's directory.

Results
Results of the analyses are written to text files within the analysis folder of each respective directory.

Code Source
This repository is populated with educational material and assignments developed by me as part of my learning journey in Python programming.
